# What is Lalaz?

Lalaz is a modern, lightweight PHP framework designed for developers who want to **build and validate ideas quickly** without wrestling with complexity.

## The Philosophy

Lalaz was born from the frustration of its creator, **Gregory Serrao**, with the modern web development landscape.

### The Problem

Building a simple web application or API shouldn't require hours of configuration, thousands of dependencies, or a PhD in DevOps. Yet, that's exactly what modern development often demands:

**🔴 The Node.js Ecosystem Chaos**

The JavaScript ecosystem has become a maze of transpilers, bundlers, and ever-changing tooling. Want to build a simple API? Prepare to choose between dozens of frameworks, configure TypeScript, set up Babel, pick a bundler, manage `node_modules` that weigh more than your operating system, and pray that `npm install` doesn't break something. It's "transpile hell" — and it shouldn't be this hard.

**🔴 Enterprise Overkill**

Many frameworks are designed for enterprise scale from day one. They come with elaborate architectures, complex dependency injection containers, service providers, facades, and abstractions on top of abstractions. Great for a Fortune 500 company with a dedicated DevOps team — overkill for validating a startup idea or building a side project.

**🔴 Laravel's Learning Curve**

Laravel is a fantastic framework — powerful, elegant, and feature-rich. But that power comes with complexity. For someone who just wants to spin up an API quickly, learning Eloquent's magic, understanding service containers, configuring queues, and navigating the ecosystem can feel overwhelming. Laravel is a sports car; sometimes you just need a bicycle.

### The Solution

Lalaz takes a different approach:

> **"Simple things should be simple. Complex things should be possible."**

Lalaz is not here to replace Laravel or compete with enterprise frameworks. It exists as a **simple alternative** for developers who want to:

- ✅ **Validate ideas fast** — From zero to working API in minutes, not hours
- ✅ **Stay in control** — Understand every line of your application
- ✅ **Avoid dependency hell** — Minimal dependencies, no transpilers, no build steps
- ✅ **Deploy anywhere** — Works on shared hosting, VPS, Docker, or serverless

### Host Anywhere

One of Lalaz's core principles is **deployment agnosticism**. Your application should run wherever you need it:

| Environment | Support |
|------------|---------|
| Shared Hosting | ✅ Just upload via FTP — it works |
| Traditional VPS | ✅ Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed |
| Docker Containers | ✅ First-class Docker support |
| Cloud Platforms | ✅ AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean |
| Serverless | ✅ Bref, Laravel Vapor compatible |

No vendor lock-in. No special requirements. PHP 8.3+ and you're good to go.

## What Lalaz Is

- **A toolkit for rapid development** — Build REST APIs, web apps, and microservices quickly
- **Modular by design** — Use only what you need through the package system
- **Modern PHP** — Built on PHP 8.3+ with attributes, typed properties, and modern patterns
- **Developer-friendly** — Clear documentation, intuitive APIs, sensible defaults
- **Lightweight** — Fast bootstrapping, minimal overhead

## What Lalaz Is Not

- **Not a Laravel replacement** — Different tool for different needs
- **Not enterprise-first** — Designed for agility, not corporate bureaucracy
- **Not magic** — Explicit over implicit; you'll understand what's happening

## Who Is Lalaz For?

- 🚀 **Indie hackers** validating startup ideas
- 👨‍💻 **Developers** building side projects
- 🏢 **Small teams** that value simplicity over ceremony
- 📚 **Learners** who want to understand how things work
- ⚡ **Anyone** frustrated with modern web development complexity

## The Name

"Lalaz" is derived from a relaxed, carefree attitude — the opposite of the stress and complexity that modern frameworks often bring. It's about getting back to the joy of building things.
